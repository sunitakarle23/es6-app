"about": "<div class=\"profile-pic\">I&rsquo;m a full-stack developer and designer from Finland. I live with my wife whom I married in New York City. I love crafting products that help get things&nbsp;done.</div>\n\n<div class=\"about-me\">\n<p>I&rsquo;ve worked at a successful product startup, in aUX&nbsp;team consulting for the biggest and smallest clients in Finland, failed a consumer iPhone app and set up sales terminals into Africa and Australia (remotely, sadly). I&nbsp;actively&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Darep\">contribute to the&nbsp;OSS&nbsp;community</a>. I also&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:ajk@ajk.fi\">freelance</a>&nbsp;via my own company whenever a cool opportunity presents&nbsp;itself.</p>\n\n<p>In design, be it&nbsp;UX&nbsp;design or software architecture design, I feel that empathy is key. Empowering your users while making sure the user feels good are the goals I aim&nbsp;for.</p>\n\n<p>In software development, my empathy-oriented philosophy means that I specialise in creating products that are easy to use, easy to maintain and easy to develop further. This is my passion; I want to create code, architecture and frameworks that empower users and other developers and give them that amazing feeling of &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s so simple, this system is&nbsp;beautiful&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m also a skilled graphic designer (though I do that less and less these&nbsp;days).</p>\n</div>\n",
